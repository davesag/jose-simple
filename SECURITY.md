## Reporting a Vulnerability

Report a vulnerability to [the author](https://about.me/davesag) directly.

You can expect to get an update on a reported vulnerability within 2 working days.

## Vulnerabilities in development dependencies

I'm using `dependabot` to scan for security issues and update dependencies in the `develop` branch regularly.
